Le FreeGo is a team of three french student developers. We had the idea of this software after one of us broke up because of this famous quote :  “What do you want to eat tonight ? - As you want”. Now, our purpose is to help all the people who struggle about making a weekly meal plan. Using FreeGo, you can suggest meals with specifications and make a shopping list. 
We are new in open source software and want to learn more and more. Please if you have any suggestion about the github or the software, tell us [here](/contactUs).
